        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Priscilla Sauri and I am 18 years old. I love cooking, singing, reading both manhwas and manhuas, and discovering new cultures (I'm currently learning German). Welcome to my webpage where you'll get to learn more about me and my hobbies ðŸ˜„. By the way, I wrote an article in French regarding the debate (free trade vs protectionism). I could also give book, series and movie recommendations.

        <h2>Readings ðŸ“š</h2>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I love to read novels, mangas, manhwas and manhuas. My favorite genres are action, historical, romance and slice of life. My favorite readings of all times are: Jane Eyre, To kill a Mockingbird, Pride and Predjudice, Solo Leveling, Eleceed, For my derelict favorite, and Torsepied. If you haven't read any of those read, DO IT, it is a MUST.

        <h2>Movie and Series </h2>
        <p>
            I have watched quite a lot of series and movie throughout my short life. One of my absolute favs is Dark Shadows featuring Johnny Depp and Elena Bonham Carter. This won't be everyone's cup of tea but it is a good option for anyone who wants to watch something entertaining and likes vampires and werewolves. I obviously watched all of the Twilight movies as well as Teen wolf, Bucky the vampire slayer, Vampire academy and My babysitter is a vampire. THese aren't for people who are very serious about a solid plot and want a super convincing acting from the performers. Honestly I feel like those are better suited for the daydreamers who watch them to get some inspo for future potential scenarios they'll make up in their mind. It is also obviously for the Wattpad lovers, ready to eat up all of the fanfictions that will emerge from it.
                A series about vampires I would recommend for people who enjoy solid plots is Castlevania: I LOVED IT and I found it super well-made.

            <div class="Why">
                <h4>Why I love that place</h4>
                <p>
                    I used to go there often with my friends back in high school as it was close to our school and was a good alternative to the usual fastfood chains available in Saint Lazare (KFC, Burger King and Macdonalds) and it cheap for a homemade burger place. 
                    TIPS: the restaurant itself is pretty small so if you want to eat inside and you're with friends you should send one to take your seats so that you'll have enough for the group (you'll notice that everyone does it so there is no need to culpabilize).
